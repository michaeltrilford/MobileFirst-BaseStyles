<h1>2015 Base Styles</h1>

Typography:

1. I have used the following values to calulate my font sizes & line-height: 16px, 18px, 21px, 24px, 36px, 48px, 60px, 72px
2. My HTML font size is 16px at Desktop, so I have used this help convert my pixel values to em units. ( Eg: 48px / 16px = 3em )
3. The Baseline is 24px ( Eg: 24px / 16px = 1.5em )

Viewport:

1. The layout is purely fluid with 90% in width.
2. At 1180px and above the layout is fixed.
